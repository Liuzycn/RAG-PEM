Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Potential Event Mining

## Overview ðŸ“š
The main goal of this project is to create a smart system for analyzing online public opinion by using past data, expert knowledge, and the latest natural language processing tech. This system will help us break down user comments or event-related info posted online, looking at things like the main points people are making, how strong their emotions are, and how similar the situation is to past public opinion events. By doing this, we can spot potential risks early and stay one step ahead.
